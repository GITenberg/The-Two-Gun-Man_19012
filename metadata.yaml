description: The Shelf2Life Western Fiction Collection is a fascinating set of pre-1923
  materials that capture the beauty, mystery and adventure of the old west. From honorable
  cowboys and spirited pioneer women to questionable sheriffs, notorious gunslingers
  and unruly outlaws, these classic westerns introduce lively characters who embody
  the essence of the American frontier. Authentic dialog combined with vivid scenic
  descriptions help re-create a time and place where chasing cattle rustlers, tracking
  wild horses and fighting for land were a part of everyday life, highlighting the
  strength of character necessary to survive. The Shelf2Life Western Fiction Collection
  allows readers to escape the modern world and be transported into the rough and
  tumble escapades of the Wild West.
